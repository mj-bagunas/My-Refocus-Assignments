Hi, I'm Mary Jane Bagunas I am an Electronics Engineer currently working in a telco industry.
Influence by a good friend I got interseted in programming which I find really hard to learn at first, but I am doing my best now to learn everything I need in order for me to shift carreers in this field.

My Hobbies:

> Watching Movies / Kdramas
> Reading Books
> Alone Time / Desocializing
> Travelling
> Practicing Coding

Goals this year:

> I just want to learn programming as deep as I can, because I dont
> wan to shift to this field wihtout much knowledge, thus I trusted
> Refocus on this career shift I'm planning.

Why I want to be a web developer?

> The main reason I want to have a career in we dev is of course
> the Pay. Salary wise, career in IT has the fastest growth according to a research I read.
> Second, this field really challenges me to think outside the box most of the time. I am really wracking my brain out on how to make things work the way I want it to be, and I love being challenge. Not that I am npt challenge in my currnt position but working in my codes helps my brain to function accordingly.
> Lastly, the convenience. Most of the web dev jobs I have checked online has a work from home set-up, which really is convenient.

I just Hope Refocus can really help me in landing a Job in web dev.
